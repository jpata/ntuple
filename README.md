ntuple
======

This package contains tools for working with EDM-style ntuples. A separate CMSSW setup is foreseen,
since the EDM-style ntuples need very few supporting libraries apart from the base CMSSW setup.

Setup
=====

CMSSW must already be set up
~~~
cd CMSSW/src
git clone -b no_cmssw https://github.com/jpata/ntuple.git
~~~
